  abstract = "Disclaimer: These recommendations are designed primarily as an
              educational resource for medical geneticists and other healthcare
              providers to help them provide quality medical services.
              Adherence to these recommendations is completely voluntary and
              does not necessarily assure a successful medical outcome. These
              recommendations should not be considered inclusive of all proper
              procedures and tests or exclusive of other procedures and tests
              that are reasonably directed toward obtaining the same results.
              In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test,
              the clinician should apply his or her own professional judgment
              to the specific clinical circumstances presented by the
              individual patient or specimen. Clinicians are encouraged to
              document the reasons for the use of a particular procedure or
              test, whether or not it is in conformance with this statement.
              Clinicians also are advised to take notice of the date this
              statement was adopted and to consider other medical and
              scientific information that becomes available after that date. It
              also would be prudent to consider whether intellectual property
              interests may restrict the performance of certain tests and other
              procedures.To promote standardized reporting of actionable
              information from clinical genomic sequencing, in 2013, the
              American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)
              published a minimum list of genes to be reported as incidental or
              secondary findings. The goal was to identify and manage risks for
              selected highly penetrant genetic disorders through established
              interventions aimed at preventing or significantly reducing
              morbidity and mortality. The ACMG subsequently established the
              Secondary Findings Maintenance Working Group to develop a process
              for curating and updating the list over time. We describe here
              the new process for accepting and evaluating nominations for
              updates to the secondary findings list. We also report outcomes
              from six nominations received in the initial 15 months after the
              process was implemented. Applying the new process while upholding
              the core principles of the original policy statement resulted in
              the addition of four genes and removal of one gene; one gene did
              not meet criteria for inclusion. The updated secondary findings
              minimum list includes 59 medically actionable genes recommended
              for return in clinical genomic sequencing. We discuss future
              areas of focus, encourage continued input from the medical
              community, and call for research on the impact of returning
              genomic secondary findings.Genet Med 19 2, 249-255.",
