We present **DeMAG** (**De**ciphering **M**utations in **A**ctionable **G**enes) a supervised and specialized VEP (Variant Effect Predictor) to interpret any missense mutations in 59 actionable genes (ACMG SF v2.0 genes).

This repository will contain the main scripts (all in R language) and data resources:
- scripts, the directory will contain R scripts to reproduce the analysis (e.g., feature selection, model training and testing),
- data, the directory will contain the training set and the validation sets used to benchmark DeMAG.


[DeMAG web server](https://demag.org) allows scientistist, clinicians or anyone curios to:
- access and download predictions for all ~1.3 million missense mutations for the ACMG SF v2.0 genes (ACMG59 genes),
- investigate the features of the model for any mutation to better understand DeMAG's pathogenicity score,
- download the high-quality training set to fully reproduce our results,
- download the validation sets we used to benchmark DeMAG against popular VEPs (REVEL, EVE, ...).

DeMAG is a joint collaboration between the Max Planck Insitute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). You can read our paper on bioRxiv:
